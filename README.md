🎨 Benjamon Portfolio

Welcome to Benjamon, my interactive personal portfolio — a creative experiment that blends data, design, and storytelling.

This project is currently a work in progress, evolving as I explore new ideas in web design, analytics visualization, and interactive media. Not everything is fully fleshed out yet, but it’s a growing space to document my skills, projects, and creative journey.

🚀 Overview

Benjamon aims to go beyond a static résumé — combining elements of a retro-inspired game interface with a modern personal website. It’s where I experiment with design systems, front-end interactivity, and portfolio storytelling.
